        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pancakes.The nutritious breakfast every body needs if we really don't know what even <em>"healthy"</em> at this point means.But we all love them,and something that sometimes we can't agree upon is that some like it fluffy,other doughy.I love them both.Reason why,here I am with a new recipes for you and your love ones <em>(or soon-to-be love ones)</em> can enjoy.</p>
        <p>Although unsual this time I do have to recommend to make this at the moment as it will <strong>NOT</strong> taste the same after a few hours.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>950 gr Buttermilk</li>
            <li>670 gr All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>4 Eggs</li>
            <li>170 gr Melted Butter</li>
            <li>6 gr Salt</li>
            <li>10 gr Baking Soda</li>
            <li>3 gr Baking Podwer</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>We will start mixing all our <strong>dry</strong> ingredients in a mixing bowl,if necessary sift them.</li> 
            <li>In another bowl we'll add the rest of them and whisk them until an homogeneous mix has been achieved.</li>
            <li>It's time to add both mixtures in the biggest bowl <em>(at once,not through parts)</em> mix them with a rubber spatula until a mix ressembling to oatmeal while being cooked has been achieved. <em>(so expect lumps,yeah)</em></li>
            <li>Finally,drop a spoon-size of your choice into a grease pan <em>(ideally cast-iron)</em> and cook them until small bubbles are present in the uncooked side.</li>
            <li><strong>Ready to eat them?</strong> Spread some butter and a splash of maple syrup and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
