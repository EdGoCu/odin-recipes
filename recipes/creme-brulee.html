    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Am I wrong to say we know what a creme brulee tastes like? Well, you are probably wrong and not in the <em>"I'm a professional chef and excuse but excuse me"</em>,it's more like <em>"I'm sorry you have had to taste that scramble-egg-so-called-creme-brulee"</em>.</p>
    <p>If you ask why.Usually there is a perception of Creme brulee with a pudding-texture,that is completely false.It's a custard and by it's name it should have a texture similar to the one you can taste inside of a Donut althogh a bit more curd.It is time now for you too achieve that texture and make your friends,love ones or yourself that you are not just <strong>fat</strong>,<em>but an elegant fat individual</em>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>200 gr Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>80 gr Whole Milk</li>
        <li>60 gr Sugar</li>
        <li>3 Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>1 tspn Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>We'll begin heating both liquids,in a small pot,without them boiling over.</li>
        <li>Next,while this is happening,we will mix everything else really fast with a whisk until a white-yellow mixture is achieved.</li>
        <li>We will add our hot pot of liquids into our bowl with eggs yolks,and mix for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Let it cool down completly and remove with a spoon or a kitchen skimmer,the white foam that has appeared <em>(I know it seems a lot,trust me,you don't want it)</em></li>
        <li>Now,it's time to put them in our ramekins and cook them in bain marie pot <em>(it could be just a deep pan with water and your ramekins)</em>, for 35 minutes at 100 Celcius.</li>
        <li>After this time,you should see the ramekins with a jigglying curd now <em>(<strong>YES</strong> is still liquid but has texture,it's all we want for now)</em></li>
        <li>Pop them in your cooler for one day and be amazed at the texture it has now.Sprinkle some white sugar on top,melted it with a torch until golden brown.And <em>"Bon Appettit!"</em></li>
    </ol>
